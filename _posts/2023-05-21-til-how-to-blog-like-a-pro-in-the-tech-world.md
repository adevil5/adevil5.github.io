_Unpacking the genius blogging tips and tricks from Simon Willison_

**Hey There, Dear Reader!**

You know what I learned today? All about how to blog like a pro, inspired by none other than programming guru, Simon Willison. The man's been sharing insights since 2002 and has some pretty solid advice about diving into the blogosphere. He’s a firm believer in the power of 'now' when it comes to starting a blog. It turns out that blogging isn't just a fun hobby; it's a career-boosting move. Let me share what I've learned today.

## Your Blog, Your Brand

The internet is like a digital billboard, and employers use it to gauge our skills and professionalism. A well-written blog post:

- Showcases your prowess in your field.
- Gives potential employers a glimpse into your problem-solving abilities.
- Demonstrates that you know how to articulate your ideas.

A few blog posts can act like a dynamic CV, giving you an edge in the job market.

## Adopting the "Today I Learned" (TIL) Format

Some believe writing is only valuable if it presents new information to the world. However, this perspective can be demotivating and hinder writing. Simon prefers the "Today I Learned" (TIL) format because it removes the pressure of creating something unique. TIL emphasizes sharing personal discoveries rather than global revelations. Here's a few more reasons why this format is fantastic:

- It's a record of your learning journey.
- There's no expectation that you'll keep it up-to-date.
- It takes 10-15 minutes to write.

## Shining a Light on Your Projects

Writing about your completed projects is another stellar use of your blog. Think of it as an open-source showcase of your work. When blogging about a project, consider:

- Explaining what the project was all about.
- Including screenshots.
- Describing the obstacles you faced and overcame.
- Sharing the end result and the lessons learned along the way.

Sharing your knowledge with others by communicating what you have built can be highly beneficial. Equally important, it can also be helpful for your future self. By documenting your work in blog entries, you can easily recall what the project entailed and how it functions without needing to rediscover your work. Essentially, you become your own guide in the future, reminiscent of a Doctor Who episode.

## Embracing Imperfection

If you wait for perfection, you may end up with a bunch of unfinished drafts in your folder. Once you publish, you can always come back and make any necessary corrections to typos or other mistakes. Remember, waiting for perfection will only slow down your publishing rate, so it's crucial to accept imperfections and keep moving forward.

## Fine-Tuning Your Writing Skills

Finally, Simon underscores the importance of developing writing skills through blogging. It's a game-changer in the tech world, especially for those who aspire to higher positions like senior or staff engineer roles.

> Clear communication is really what distinguishes senior engineers from less senior engineers. And blogging is such a great way of of developing those writing skills.

**Wrapping Up**

Well, that’s what I learned today, thanks to Simon Willison. Each blog post, whether it's a TIL like this one or a project showcase, contributes to your personal and professional development. It's time to bid farewell to the fear of imperfection and start sharing our knowledge with the world. Let's get blogging!
