        <h3>Account Degree</h3>
      <p>For business owners, it's important to invest in a strong financial team - accountants, bookkeepers, financial analysts, and controllers - because it can mean the difference between the company succeeding or failing. As a result, industry leaders want skilled and service-oriented accounting and finance professionals on staff. Whether you're seeking a two-year degree to get started in this rewarding and high-earning field or to earn the 30 accounting hours needed to meet the educational requirements of the North Carolina Uniform Certified Public Accountant Examination (CPA), let Central Piedmont be your gateway to achieving your academic and career goals.</p>
